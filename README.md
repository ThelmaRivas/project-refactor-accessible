# Project-refactor-accessible

## Description
This is a basic introductive HTML and CSS project, with the challenge on-the-job ticket, in other words, having a starter code that needs to be modify or debug.

 In this project we took a starter code and refactor it, with the goal of making it more accessible for all types of users, thats why we implement alt attributes in all images. Accessibility is a very important task for developers, making a website/application suitable for people with dissabilities is something every developer should have in mind.

 Another part of the challenge was to give it more structure to the existing code in the HTML and CSS files, add semantic HTML elements and make them follow a logical structure, verify that heading fall in sequential order and give a descriptive title to the website.   

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can see HTML file and CSS file inside assets folder and find semantic HTML elements, all the divs where replace with <header>, <section>, <nav>, <footer>, and other semantic elements, also verify that the HTML now counts with accessible standards such as the alt attribute on the images located in the <main> and <aside>.
On the CSS you can see the styling being applied to the now structured HTML with some comments along the file, also we reduce the lines of code to make a more efficient/optimize code.
